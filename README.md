# 📈 Stock Market Trend Prediction

This project explores stock market trends using machine learning models to analyze historical financial data and predict future movement patterns. The system aims to provide short-term direction classification (uptrend or downtrend) for specific stock tickers.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Stock Data Source**: Yahoo Finance historical data using `yfinance` or `.csv` imports
- **Feature Engineering**: Price-based indicators, moving averages, technical signals
- **ML Models Used**: 
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - LSTM (Recurrent Neural Networks)
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
- **Visualization**: Price charts, prediction overlays, and trend plots
